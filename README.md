## Notes

1. Good practice to keep visuals and logic separate. In interest of this, the Player object was created for the logic, and an object inside that was created for the visuals.
2. You can only animate child objects. Another good reason to keep the visuals and logic separate.
3. Always remember to zero the position of new objects and things you add to the game (set position coordinates to 0, 0, 0)
